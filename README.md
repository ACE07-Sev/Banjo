## Description

"Bravo 6, this is 7-1. We are in pursuit of the subject. Shi-"
"7-1 respond. 7-1 how copy!?"

Banjo is a 2D platformer game with pixel artstyle, following the story of Banjo, a mutated Banjo Frog who has become predatorial, vicious, and somehow still lovable. Follow his journey as he tears Bravo team apart to get to the swamps, as he did in his life every fall. This natural instinct is all that drives him, and he will not stop at anything to reach downstream (get it? Yeah, those who need get it, *cough pyweek).

## Quickstart

Simply run the `main.py` to run the code. As of 28/4/2025 the code is still incomplete and only provides access to trying the core mechanics. Feel free to add your cool features, NPCs, or whatever. Banjo likes variety. Try the `ace` branch for now.
